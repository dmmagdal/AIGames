# AI Games

Description: This repo connects to other repos I have (along with their last updated states) in which I develop AI to play games. These games can be a part of past or current competitions. The goal for many of these games is that I am able to clone a copy of the game and run it locally to train and validate my own AI agents that I code.


### Games/Projects

 - [HaliteRL](https://github.com/dmmagdal/HaliteRL): Plays the games from the halite challenges by twosigma.
     - Challenge Home: https://github.com/HaliteChallenge (original http://halite.io/ link/website by twosigma is now defunct)
     - Supports Local Games: Yes
     - Status:
         - 12/27/2023: Have successfully cloned all the repos from the HaliteChallenge repository (gives Halite, Halite-II, & Halite-III). However, I do not have the required halite executable files (for Windows, MacOS, nor Linux) and thus, I cannot play the game locally. There are no real instructions on how to compile the games from the repos. I then tried to access the Halite-III game from Kaggle's environments package but issues with dependencies made it not possible for my macbook to run it at all (have yet to test on other devices). Any further attempts to develop AI for the game(s) is on hold until I can get the game running locally on any of my systems (but especially macOS since that is my current laptop).
